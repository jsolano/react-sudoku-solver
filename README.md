## React Sudoku Solver. Author J.P. Solano

This is a fresh attempt to port Peter Norvig's @norvig legendary Sudoku Solver from an hyper-efficient python base code
to JS. See http://norvig.com/sudoku.html for his article and explanations.

The latest js version that port Peter code was from 2014 (thanks to @einaregilsson /sudoku !)

## General idea:

Initially was just create a react app that used Peter Norvig's approach to solve any sudoku puzzle while collecting all steps to learn. But, Peter Norvig used a backtracking search strategy, and what it does is systematically try all possibilities until it hit one that works. In the search of a solution create temp steps that are not valid, making the learning part pointless.

Then I did my research about others sudoku solving strategies, and there are more than 38 options! I was hook. See more here [https://www.sudokuwiki.org/sudoku.htm](https://www.sudokuwiki.org/sudoku.htm).

But it comes with a caveats: you can produce many lines of code trying to implement some of this strategies and still won't solve all puzzles. (I learned this the hard way). So, here is a mixed approach: Create a react app that use human solving strategies (for learning purposes and because it's fun!) and only apply Peter Norvig's nuclear solver as the last option.

## Next Steps

**DONE** In the modal for Load a new Board, Add a button to select a random puzzle string.

Below you will find some information on how to perform common tasks.<br>

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

Before anything:

### `npm install | yarn`

After

### `npm|yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm|yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](#running-tests) for more information.

### `npm|yarn run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](#deployment) for more information.

### `npm|yarn run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Supported Browsers

By default, the generated project uses the latest version of React.

You can refer [to the React documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html#browser-support) for more information about supported browsers.
